Web Components includes technologies such as Custom Elements, Templates, and Shadow DOM, and can be used in any modern browser independently of a framework. This allows Web Components to maintain consistent behavior and styles across different JavaScript frameworks or libraries, and is ideal for building cross-platform, modular UI components.\r\nFor more information about Web Components, please refer to the official documentation: [Web Components Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)\r\n# Stencil Introduction\r\nStencil is a framework that focuses on building Web Components, helping developers build efficient, modular components using native Web technologies. Stencil provides features such as incremental compilation, on-demand loading, and automatic optimization to generate lightweight Web components. It supports TypeScript and JSX, allowing developers to efficiently develop and maintain components.\r\nFor detailed documentation on Stencil, please refer to: [Stencil Documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs)\r\n# Tailwind CSS Introduction\r\nTailwind CSS is a practical CSS framework that helps developers build responsive UIs in a declarative way through predefined utility classes. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, Tailwind CSS provides a high degree of customizability, allowing developers to customize their own design systems according to project requirements. At the same time, Tailwind CSS can also be used with a toolchain to implement on-demand loading, which greatly reduces the volume of generated CSS.\r\nYou can read more about Tailwind CSS at [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)\r\n# React vs Stencil\r\nWhile developing `air-components`, I gained a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between Stencil and React. Although they are different technology stacks, they have many similarities in component-based development:\r\n## Similarities\r\n1. **JSX syntax**: React and Stencil both use similar JSX syntax to structure components, making development very similar.\r\n2. **Component-based thinking**: Both follow the component-based development philosophy, encouraging developers to break down the UI into multiple widgets and combine these widgets to build a complete interface.\r\n3. **Lifecycle management**: React uses lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount`, while Stencil uses hooks such as `connectedCallback` and `disconnectedCallback`.\r\n4. **State management**: React manages state through `state` and `setState`, while Stencil uses the `@State()` decorator.\r\n5. **Prop passing**: React passes data to child components via `props`, while Stencil defines properties via the `@Prop()` decorator.\r\n## Differences\r\n1. **Framework dependency**: Stencil generates native Web Components that can be used in any modern browser, while React depends on its ecosystem.\r\n2. **Performance optimization**: Stencil provides on-demand loading and incremental compilation, which is suitable for developing lightweight components, while React is more suitable for building complex single-page applications.\r\nCompared with React, I realized that Stencil provides more flexibility in component-based development, especially for cross-platform development that does not rely on a specific framework.\r\n# air-components and air-components-start\r\n`air-components` is a simple, efficient and easily extensible library of UI components that provides some commonly used UI components such as buttons (`air-button`), cards (`air-card`) and paragraphs (`air-paragraph`). These components are carefully designed to maintain a responsive performance on different devices and can be seamlessly integrated into any modern framework or native web project.\r\nTo help developers get started quickly, I created `air-components-start`. This is a simplified template project that comes preconfigured with the necessary tools and dependencies, based on best practices and reduces the workload of developers starting from scratch.\r\n![Insert image description here](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/ccc22c07e0d246478d3c3d31797b312b.jpeg#pic_center)\r\n## Using `air-components-start`\r\n1. Clone the template project:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/SisyphusZheng/air-components-start.git\r\n```\r\n2. Install dependencies:\r\n```bash\r\ncd air-components-start && npm install\r\n```\r\n3. Start the development environment:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n# Framework structure\r\n## Why Stencil + Tailwind CSS\r\n### Stencil advantages\r\n1. **Native support for Web Components**: No need to rely on other front-end frameworks, components can be run directly in any modern browser.\r\n2. **Automatic optimization**: Provides code cleaning and efficient packaging functions to generate lightweight components.\r\n3. **Support for TypeScript**: Provides type safety and higher development efficiency.\r\n4. **High performance**: Faster development and faster running speeds through incremental compilation and on-demand loading.\r\n### Tailwind CSS advantages\r\n1. **Class names are design**: Responsive layouts and custom designs can be implemented quickly by using predefined tool classes.\r\n2. **Highly customizable**: The design system can be easily adjusted using configuration files.\r\n3. **Load on demand**: The tool chain can be combined to greatly reduce the size of the generated CSS.\r\n# Practical process\r\n## 1. Environment setup\r\nDuring the initialization of the `air-components` project, I took the following steps:\r\n1. **Initialize the project**: Quickly create a new project using the official Stencil CLI.\r\n2. **Integrate Tailwind CSS**: Use the open source [stencil-tailwind-plugin\r\n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stencil-tailwind-plugin)\r\n3. **Configuration file optimization**: Tailor `tailwind.config.js` and Stencil configuration files to your project's needs.\r\n## 2. Building basic components\r\nThe current `air-components` includes the following basic components:\r\n### air-button\r\nA fully functional button component that supports multiple states (default, hover, disabled, etc.) and provides a consistent design style.\r\n### air-card\r\nA reusable card component that supports a combination of images, titles, and descriptions.\r\n## 3. Style management\r\n1. **Global styles**: Global style rules such as color themes and font settings are defined in `global.css`.\r\n2. **Component-specific styles**: Each component is independently styled using Tailwind CSS utility class names to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance.\r\n## Design reference: quakdUI\r\nTo improve the design inspiration of air-components, I referenced quakdUI as an excellent example of a design system. quakdUI provides a clean, modern, and highly customizable design style. Its components focus on visual consistency and simplicity, which is very consistent with the design philosophy of air-components. You can adjust the color, spacing, and layout of components based on the design philosophy of quakdUI to give them a consistent look and feel in different UI environments.\r\n# Summary\r\nBy developing `air-components` using Stencil and Tailwind CSS, we can quickly build efficient, responsive UI components. These components not only have excellent cross-platform compatibility, but also reduce the learning curve for developers through the template project `air-components-start`, providing a solid foundation for building modern web applications."}],"blogListPaginated":[{"items":["trying"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":1,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"blogTags":{},"blogTagsListPath":"/blog/tags","authorsMap":{"zhizheng":{"name":"zhi zheng","title":"Front End Engineer @ Facebook","url":"https://github.com/yangshun","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/zhizheng"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/yangshun"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yangshun","key":"zhizheng"}}}},"docusaurus-plugin-content-pages":{"default":[{"type":"jsx","permalink":"/","source":"@site/src/pages/index.js"},{"type":"mdx","permalink":"/markdown-page","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-pages/markdown-page.md","title":"Markdown page example","description":"You don't need React to write simple standalone pages.","frontMatter":{"title":"Markdown page example"},"unlisted":false}]},"docusaurus-plugin-debug":{},"docusaurus-plugin-svgr":{},"docusaurus-theme-classic":{},"@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local":{},"docusaurus-theme-live-codeblock":{},"docusaurus-bootstrap-plugin":{},"docusaurus-mdx-fallback-plugin":{}}}
