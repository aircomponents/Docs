The **AirComponent Design System** is built to provide a highly flexible and standardized design framework, leveraging the power of **TailwindCSS** through a second-level encapsulation. This system focuses on delivering a **semantic**, **accessible**, and **scalable** user interface foundation that prioritizes clarity and consistency.

By encapsulating TailwindCSS, we aim to create a set of utility-first styles that maintain a clean and efficient codebase while enabling developers to focus on building user-friendly, adaptable components. Every style, class, and component has been carefully structured to align with modern **semantic design principles**, ensuring that each element serves its intended purpose and contributes to an intuitive user experience.

### Key features of the **AirComponent Design System**:
- **Semantic HTML & CSS**: Every class and utility is built with semantic meaning in mind, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
- **Consistency**: A strong emphasis on uniformity across the entire design system, ensuring that components interact smoothly and behave predictably.
- **Customizability**: By extending TailwindCSS with thoughtful configurations, the system provides a high degree of flexibility while preserving design integrity.
- **Scalable**: Designed to grow with your project, whether it’s a small application or a large-scale enterprise platform.

With the **AirComponent Design System**, you’ll have a powerful yet simple toolkit that supports the development of modern web applications, rooted in the fundamentals of responsive, accessible, and clean design.
